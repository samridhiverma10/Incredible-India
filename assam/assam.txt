Assam is a state of breath-taking scenic beauty, rarest flora and fauna, vast rolling plain, mighty waterways and a land of fairs and festivals. It shares its borders in the North and East with the Kingdom of Bhutan and Arunachal Pradesh. Along the south lie Nagaland, Manipur and Mizoram. Meghalaya lies to her South-West, Bengal and Bangladesh to her West. Assam has many fascinating aspects to experience, including the Kaziranga National Park, home to the world famous and rare one horned rhinoceros, the remarkable Majuliisland, ancient Ahom architectural marvels and numerous Golf courses backed by beautiful heritage/luxury resorts and colonial tea bungalows. Renowned for its tea, rich flora and fauna and other rare species of wildlife on the verge of extinction, there is perhaps no part of the world where such a variety of wildlife exists barring Africa.
