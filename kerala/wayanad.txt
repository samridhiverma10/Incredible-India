Wayanad is one of the districts in Kerala that has been able to retain its pristine nature. Hidden away in the hills of this land are some of the oldest tribes, as yet untouched by civilisation. Wayanad is known for its picturesque mist clad hill stations, sprawling spice plantations, luxuriant forests and rich cultural traditions. Kalpetta is the headquarters of the district. Mananthavady, Sulthan Bathery and Vythiri are other important towns in the district. The leading tourist centers of South India like Ooty, Mysore, Coorg, Kozhikode and Kannur are around this region.
