There is nowhere else quite like Munnar, and that is why so many travellers have a holiday in Munnar as top of their wish lists while travelleing to Kerala. Located at an altitude of 1600m, at the confluence of the Muthirappuzha, Chadavurai,   and  Kundaly rivers, it was once the summer resort of the British. Munnar  holds great appeal for those with an appreciative eye for exquisite beauty - from unending expanse of tea plantations to pristine valleys and the verdant mountains of the Western Ghats; and from national parks and sanctuaries teeming with wildlife, to the beautiful lakes.
