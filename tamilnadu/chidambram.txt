Chidambram is a holy pilgrimage site for devotees of Lord Shiva and Lord Vishnu. Legend has it that Lord Shiva himself came to reside here to please the saints but found that Godess Kali was already in residence. It was decided that a dance competition would be held and the winner would reside in Chidambram. Lord Shiva performed his cosmic dance Tandav while the Lasya was performed by Goddess Kali. Lord Shiva won the competition and became Lord of Chidambaram. The dance performed by Shiva came to be known as Oorthuva Thandavam. In recent times, Chidambaram has also become well known for the Annamalai University, the first residential university in Tamil Nadu.
