Udhagamandalam or Ooty, located at an altitude of 2,240 m, has a unique flavour among Indian towns. Its history, coupled with the pleasant temperate mountain climate and beautiful scenic grandeur against the backdrop of Nilgiri Hills, gives it a colonial charm, typical of a British era hill town which, in fact, it once was. Udhagamandalam was founded in 1819 by John Sullivan, the then Governor of Coimbatore, who promoted the place’s charms. Udhagamandalam‘s temperatures hover between 9°C to 19°C, offering a cool retreat from the heat of the plains below. It is for this and the beautiful greenery that the town of Udhagamandalam is rightly known as the Queen of Hills.
