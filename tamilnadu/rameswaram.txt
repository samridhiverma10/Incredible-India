Rameswaram, the holy island in the Gulf of Mannar, is a major pilgrim centre of the country. Rameswaram is hallowed by the epic Ramayana. It is believed that Lord Rama sanctified this place by worshipping Lord Shiva here after the war against Ravana of Sri Lanka. Therefore, it is held sacred by both Vishnu and Shiva devotees. It is one of the 12 Jyothirlinga shrines (where Lord Shiva is worshipped as a ‘Lingam (pillar) of light’) of India. A devout Hindu who visits Varanasi in the North must also visit Rameswaram for the culmination of his quest for salvation.
