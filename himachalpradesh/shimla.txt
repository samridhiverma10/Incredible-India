Located deep in the Himalayan foothills and entirely surrounded by dense forest and magnificent mountains, Simla (now spelled Shimla) was the glorious summer resort of the British Raj. One of the most popular hill stations in India, the city sits at an altitude of 2213 meters and is the present capital of Himachal Pradesh. The imposing six-story Scottish baronial mansion known as Viceregal Lodge, summer seat of the British government until the 1940s, is undoubtedly Shimla’s best-loved colonial attraction. Shimla, which has the distinction of inspiring scenes from Rudyard Kipling's Kim, is also a base for visitors who come to seek adventure in other parts of the state.
