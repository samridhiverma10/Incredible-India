Rishikesh, the 'place of the sages' is a celebrated spiritual town located on the banks of the Ganga, surrounded by Shivalik range of the Himalayas on three sides. It is believed that when Raibhya Rishi undertook rigorous penance, God appeared in the form of "Hrishikesh" and this area henceforth came to be known as Rishikesh. It is the starting point for the Hindu Char Dham pilgrimage, including Yamunotri, Gangotri, Kedarnath and Badrinath, to seek spiritual salvation. Rishikesh is an ideal destination not only for pilgrims but also for those who want to delve deeper into meditation, yoga and other aspects of ancient practices. Rishikesh is also called the "Yoga capital of the world". For the adventurous, Rishikesh is the place for starting their trekking expeditions and excursions towards the Himalayan peaks. The International Yoga week, which attracts participation from all across the world, is held here every year from February 2 to 7 on the banks of river Ganga.
