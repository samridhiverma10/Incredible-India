Mussoorie, known as the Queen of the Hills, famous for its scenic beauty, is a fascinating hill resort. It commands a wonderful view of the extensive Himalayan snow ranges in the north-west and glittering views of the Doon Valley, Roorkee, Saharanpur and Haridwar in the South. Mussoorie was discovered by Captain Young, an adventurous military officer in 1827, who was lured by the extraordinarily beautiful ridge and laid its foundation. The town retains much of its colonial charm and is well worth a visit for its beautiful scenery and lovely walks.
