Retaining a feast of British Raj architecture as well as home to two grandiose tombs, Lucknow was the administrative and cultural hub of the Nawabs of Avadh (Oudh). During the period of the weakening of the Mughal Empire, the city rose into prominence as a centre for poetry, music, dance and courtly diction. Modern Lucknow, extending along the banks of the Gomti River, is a seamless blend of the medieval and the modern, as new shopping complexes and ultra-modern mall are popping up all over the city. Today capital of the most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, it is a fabulous place to sample its elaborate cuisine for which the city is widely known.
