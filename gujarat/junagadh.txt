Located at the base of spectacular Girnar Hills, Junagadh, headquarters of the district of the same name, is an ancient fortified city, rich in myth and legend. A princely state in British India, the place is named after the ‘Old Fort’ which encircled the old city. The presence of 14 Rock Edicts of the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka cut into a big rock outside the city bears testimony to its antiquity and attracts the historically minded. One of the reasons for visiting Junagadh is to transit to Sasangir, the entrancing preserve of Asiatic lion or to tour the beautiful shrine of Somnath.
