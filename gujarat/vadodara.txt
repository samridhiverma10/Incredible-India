Situated on the banks of the Vishwamitri River, Vadodara, commonly called Baroda, is a city of beautiful gardens, magnificent palaces and many institutions of learning. Formerly the capital of the princely Gaekwad state, the city is today a thriving industrial and commercial centre. Home to an impressive museum, overwrought Indo-Saracenic palace and beautiful Tambekar Wada, the place is also an excellent base to explore the wonderful UNESCO World Heritage site of Champaner. If you visit Vadodara during Navratri, the nine night festival of dance in worship of the Mother Goddess, then you are in the most sought-after location for the event.
