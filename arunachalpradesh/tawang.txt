 Tawang is believed to have derived its name from the grandiose Tawang Monastery perched on the edge of the ridge running along the western part of Tawang township. Ta means Horse and Wang means chosen. As the legend goes the site of the present monastery is believed to have chosen by a Horse owned by Merag Lama Lodre Gyamtso. Mera Lama Lodre Gyamtso who was on a search for an appropriate place to establish Monastery was unable to locate any appropriate site so, finally decided to sit on prayer for a guidance of a divine power. As he opened his eyes after prayer, he found his horse missing. So, wearily he went out searching his horse and found it on the top of the hill known as Tana Mandekhang where once stood a palace of King Kala Wangpo. Believed it a good omen, Mera Lama Lodre Gyamtso decided to initiate a work for building up of a monastery with the help of people living across the land of Monpas. This Monastery was founded by Mera Lama Lodre Gyamtso in late 1681 according to the wishes of 5th Dalai Lama. However, there is a another belief of derivation of name Tawang. The great treasure Revealer, Terton Pemalingpa gave initiation such as Tamdin and Ka-gyad and hence the place came to be known as Tawang.
