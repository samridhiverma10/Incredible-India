Vaishali attracts visitors who come to this district town in Bihar for a close encounter with history and spirituality. One of the greatest cities of the 5th century BC, Vaishali is credited with being the world's first republic to have a duly elected assembly of representatives and efficient administration. The place finds mention in the great epic Ramayana. Buddha spent the last rainy season of life near the city of Vaishali and Lord Mahavir, the founder of Jainism, was born here. The second Buddhist Council was held in this town 100 years after Buddha’s death.
