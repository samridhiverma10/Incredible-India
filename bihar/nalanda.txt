The ruins of Nalanda stand testimony to one of the greatest centres of learning in recorded history. This once world famous university attracted students from other parts of the world during the 5th-12th centuries AD. A famous centre of Buddhist learning in ancient India, the University of Nalanda has been referred to by the renowned 7th century Chinese traveller Hiuen-Tsang in glowing terms. Nalanda is also the birthplace of Sariputra, one of the chief disciples of the Lord Buddha. The antiquity of the place can be gauged from the fact that the Buddha used to make frequent visits to this place.
