The port city of Mangalore is situated at the source and confluence of two rivers -- Netravati and Gurpur. It derives its name from Queen Mangaladevi who is said to have lived here in the 10th century AD. Mangalore was ruled by several dynasties, including the Kadambas, Vijayanagar, Chalukyas, Rashtrakutas, and Hoysalas, followed by the Portuguese from 1498, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama landed at St Mary's Island near Mangalore. Eventually, the city was annexed by the British in 1799. Today, Mangalore is a major port of South India and handles over 75 percent of India's coffee exports and the bulk of the nation's cashew exports.
