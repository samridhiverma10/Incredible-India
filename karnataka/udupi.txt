Approximately 60km from Mangalore is the famous Vaishnavite pilgrimage town of Udupi, also known as Rajata Peetha and Shivalli. This was the sanctum of Madhwacharya, the great Sanskrit philosopher. It is as much renowned for its chefs, cuisine, and restaurants as it is for its Krishna Temple and various mutts. The main attraction at this temple is the 'Kanakana Kindi' - a small window through which Krishna is believed to have given darshan to his ardent devotee, Kanakadasa, a saint-minstrel. The colourful Paryaya festival, when officiating priests hand over their responsibilities to other pontiff, beckons thousands of devotees from all over the country every alternate year.
