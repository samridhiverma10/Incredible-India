Mysore was the political capital of the Wodeyar dynasty which ruled Karnataka for some 150 years till the independence of the country from the British. The kings, great patrons of art and culture, developed Mysore as an important centre of religion, education and culture. It was the Wodeyars who instituted the tradition of the grand celebration of Dasara festival, the 10-day festivities that celebrated its 400th anniversary in 2010. Today, Mysore is a city of palaces, gardens, shady avenues and sacred temples and retains some of the charm of the old world while stepping into modernity with enthusiasm.
