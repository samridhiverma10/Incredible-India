Located in the state of West Bengal, the Sundarban National park is an entrancing preserve for the Royal Bengal Tigers. It is the Ganges River together with the Brahmaputra and the Meghnarivers that create the world’s largest estuarine delta filled with lush vegetation, islands of salt-tolerant mangrove forests that make up what is described as a biodiversity hotspot. Though the undisputed highlight of the Sundarban National Park is obviously the Royal Bengal Tiger, the park is home to wide range of fauna, including 260 species of birds, aquatic mammals and other endangered species such as the estuarine crocodile and the Indian python. Declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1987, the Sundarbans mangrove forest is a dazzling panorama of wildlife in a spectacular natural setting.
