Situated in the heart of the Thar Desert, the Jaisalmer Fort seems suddenly to rise out of the desert haze, a magnificent edifice of massive yellow sandstone ramparts and bastions bathed golden in the sunlight. The city was founded in 1156 by Rawal Jaisal, a Bhati Rajput King, after whom it is named – and till today exudes an age-old aura of valour and royalty. Apart from the spectacular golden fort or Sonar Qila, as it is known locally, Jaisalmer also boasts of some beautifully constructed medieval Havelis and a Jain temple.
