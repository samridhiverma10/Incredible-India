Located almost on the edge of the Thar Desert, the city of Jodhpur was founded in 1459 by Rao Jodha, the chief of the Rathore clan of Rajputs and was the capital of the State of Marwar. Jodhpur is also known as the Sun City because the sun shines brightly here every day of the year, and as Blue City since most houses in the old part of the city are painted blue. The forts and palaces, temples and havelis, culture and tradition, spices and fabrics, colour and texture, a booming handicrafts industry, all add up to make this historic city worth a visit.
