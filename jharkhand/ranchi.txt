Once the summer headquarters of Bihar in the British Raj, Ranchi is the capital of the newly created state of Jharkhand. Ranchi has an undeniable charm and the nearby waterfalls, verdant hills and forest are first ports of call for the travellers. The city is the leaping off point for the Betla National Park that lures wildlife enthusiasts to this eastern state of India. Located at an altitude of 2140 feet in the valley of Chotanagpur, the picturesque city of Ranchi is a travel destination with beautiful attractions and provides relief, to some extent, from the sweltering heat of the plains.
