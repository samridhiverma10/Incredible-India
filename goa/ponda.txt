Introducing Ponda
If you are looking for a connection between Goa's powerful deities and their passionate devotees, then Ponda is a good place to soak yourself in spirituality. Ponda, Goa's temple town will compel you to imagine what the state would have been like, if the Portuguese had not strolled beyond Africa. 

 Ponda came under Portuguese rule in the year 1549. The Portuguese destroyed the Adil Shah Fort in 1549, but Shivaji captured the fort and reconstructed it in 1675. In 1791, Portuguese once again occupied Ponda after defeating the king of Sonda. The king of Sonda was sympathetic to the conditions of the fleeing Hindus and suggested them to conduct their religious rites in the temples of Ponda. A dozen of temples were founded in Ponda during his time to save the Gods from Portuguese attack, but the Portuguese ultimately destroyed those temples. Today, Ponda looks like any other Indian town, with hardly any trace of the Portuguese, except the 18th century Municipal Building

 Ponda is famous as the home to five of Goa's important Hindu Temples and also the largest mosque of Goa. You can see a number of unique Hindu Temples, most of these look relatively new as they have been rebuilt after being destroyed by the Portuguese.
