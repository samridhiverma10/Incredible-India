Introducing Canacona
Of course, you have explored the marvellous expanses of palm fringed white sands and blue seas, magnificent churches and temples, delightful old mansion and villas, but your Goan tour does not end here, there is much more to see in this lush green paradise. Now your next destination is the Goa's southernmost territory, Canacona - one of the five Talukas of Goa, which boasts of some of the Goa's most spectacular scenery.

 Set against the picturesque backdrop of Sahyadri mountain range, Canacona is edged by the Arabian sea on its one side. Canacona shares boundaries with Quepeum Taluka in the north and Sangeum Taluka in the north-east, to its south lies the state of Karnataka. Chaudi is the administrative headquarters of Canacona Taluka and it also serves as the gateway to the beaches of South Goa including Agonda and Palolem. 

 The history of Canacona states that it was a part of Kingdom of Sonda, a fragment of the mighty Vijayanagar Empire. But the Raja of Sonda got into trouble in 1764, when Hyder Ali of Mysore attacked him. The King asked the Portuguese for asylum and handed Canacona over to them, later it was merged into the state of Goa in 1794. Canacona came under Portuguese influence and went through many conversions in the 18th century. Like most of Goa, you will find little European impact in this pastoral part of Goa.
