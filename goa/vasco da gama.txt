Introducing Vasco da Gama
Vasco is a bustling city always on the move, because it home to Goa's natural harbour Mormugao Port and Dabolim airport, the only airport of Goa. In fact, Vasco is bestowed with a lot of water, swaying palms, sunshine and soothing climate, but the town doesn't provoke you to laze around and savor it all in. This Portuguese port city is also home to people from across India, so wherever you come to Vasco, you will feel that you are in mini-India. 

 The history states that Vasco came under the rule of Portuguese in 1543 and within a span of few years it became one of the important ports of India. A fort named as Sada Fort was constructed here to monitor the movements of ships into the Zuari river. Soon after its construction, the fort was abandoned and today some remnants of the ramparts can be seen. At the base of the ruined fort is a picturesque beach, which can be reached via steps leading down the steep rock. 

 Named after Portugal's greatest sailor Vasco-da-Gama, Vasco missed being the capital of Goa by a whisker. In 1684, the Viceroy D Francisco de Tavora, decided to shift the capital from Old Goa to Mormugao peninsula. A number of buildings were built that include the Viceroy's House, offices and warehouses, but the Lisbon Court cancelled the plan in 1712. Despite the fact, Vasco remains the only city in Goa which has air, rail, road and sea links. Today, Vasco is a well-planned city with a geometric road network, with two main avenues interlinked by small bylanes.
