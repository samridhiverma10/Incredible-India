Amritsar, literally a Pool of Nectar, derives its name from Amrit Sarovar, the holy tank that surrounds the splendid Golden Temple. Guru Ramdas, the fourth Guru of the Sikh faith, founded Amritsar in 1579. He constructed a pool on land gifted by the Mughal Emperor Akbar and called it Amritsar. Home to the world famous Golden Temple, the 400-year-old city of Amritsar is the most important seat of Sikh history and culture. One of the most poignant memorials of free India -- Jallianwala Bagh – is also located in the city. Amritsar district was once a part of the vast area covered by the Indus valley Civilisation during the early period of history.
