The ancient city of Ujjain lies on the banks of river Shipra. The number of temples in Ujjain, it is popularly held, are so many, that if one comes here with two cartloads of grain and offers only one handful at each temple, one would still run short of offerings. Legend has it that Ujjain is one of the saptapuris, or the seven holy cities of India that grant moksha or liberation from the cycle of birth and death. Ujjain hosts the Simhasth, as the Kumbh Mela is known here, every 12 years, the latest of which was in 2004.
