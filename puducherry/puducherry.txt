A French colony up to 1954, Puducherry (earlier known as Pondicherry) is a small conclave in India that retains a distinctly French ambience and culture. This small, quiet Union Territory is well known for its fine cuisine and good hotels. The Ashram founded by Sri Aurobindo, the well-known philosopher, attracts thousands of people from all over the country and abroad who come here to learn yoga and to meditate. Puducherry is definitely a place to unwind for a great weekend getaway from Chennai or Bengaluru.
