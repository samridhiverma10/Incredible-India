Chandigarh comes lauded as India’s most beautiful city, and it lives up to it - it's delightful. Lying in the valley surrounded by Shiwalik Hills that hem the great Himalayas, the city, apart from being a Union Territory, also serves the capital of two states of India – Punjab and Haryana. A model for urban planners throughout the world, Chandigarh is an appealing, well-functioning clean city featuring wide avenues, grand parks, beautiful lakes, awesome gardens and architectural gems of the great French architect Le Corbusier. The place is also the reference point to visit the famous hill resorts of Shimla Kullu, Manali, Dharmashala and Dalhousie.
