Endowed with nature's munificence, the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli is wedged between the highly industrialised cities of Mumbai, Surat and Vapi. From 1779 to 1954, the land was administered by the Portuguese colonialists and later, after its liberation, by a local administration until 1961 when it was merged with the Indian Union. The capital, Silvassa, is a laidback, sleepy town with tall trees lining the roads, lush green forests and quaint sylvan surroundings. With an area of 487 sq km, the union territory captivates tourists with its promise of a gorgeous kaleidoscope of flora and fauna and matchless colonial charm.
