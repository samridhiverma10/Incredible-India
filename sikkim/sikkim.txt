Sikkim is sheer magic. This is not just one of the most beautiful places in the world but the cleanest and safest too. If once the charms of the state were limited to mists, mountains and colourful butterflies, they are now complimented by tangible development and progress. With its unique culture and natural landscape, Sikkim is a picture of perfection and pristine purity. Nestled in the Himalayas and endowed with exceptional natural resources, Sikkim is a hotspot of biodiversity and development. This state has the unique distinction of being bounded by three sovereign nations: Nepal in the west, Bhutan in the east and China’s Tibet in the north.
