Located on the banks of Jhelum in the heart of the Kashmir valley, Srinagar is very much a niche tourism town, attracting a steady flow of tourists from all parts of India and abroad. A travel to the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir is a fairytale panoramic tour through the mountains where nature is both the backdrop and the director. The beautiful placid mountain-backed Dal and Nagin lakes, the unique accommodation in houseboats, the blossoming gardens and the waterways with their own quaint lifestyle make Srinagar a paradise for holidaymakers and nature lovers. The city is also the base to enjoy some of the best hiking, mountain biking, river rafting opportunities in India.
