Mizoram is veritable treasure trove of natural beauty with its endless variety of landscape, hilly terrains, meandering streams, deep gorges, and rich wealth of flora and fauna. Flanked by Bangladesh on the west and Myanmar on the east and south, Mizoram occupies an importance strategic position having a long international boundary of 722 km. Mizoram is one of India’s most sparsely populated states but has a dazzling mix of cross-cultural vibrancy. Renowned for their hospitality, Mizos are a close-knit society with no class distinction or discrimination on grounds of gender. The entire society is knitted together by a code of ethics -- 'Tlawmngaihna' -- an untranslatable term meaning that everyone has a duty to be hospitable kind, unselfish and helpful to others.
